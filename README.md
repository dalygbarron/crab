# Crab (not real title)
This game is a mecha space game where you are in mars which is your home but it is getting overrun by a lot of space
crabs.

## General Ideas
The game should make mechas look kinda heroic while looking down on less human like forms of weapon. This is because
the mecha is a form of tool which extends human capabilities and makes them more superior. On the other hand more
computer controlled or unhuman kinds of weapon are not really an extension of the human and are more like making a
a slave to it's workings and are therefore gay.

For example in ancient times people had to run around with spears and shit hunting for animals but now they sit around
telling alexa to feed food into their mouths. Therefore the progress of technology is not inherently a good thing and
that is because technology falls into two categories: "tools" and "machines (or think of better word)". Tools are an
extension of the humans themselves and therefore their progress makes humans become more superior, while machines do the
oppsite, and for every piece of progress in the world of machines, humans have become more contemptible to even it out.

The space crabs are in fact themselves humans that have been degraded into some kind of pest species with chemicals
and reverse evolution.

## Gameplay
### Time
I want the time taken to perform a given action to be very clear and I want every action to have an associated time
taken. This will be measured in "cycles". In order to save screen space I will just add a little clock icon or sometihng
and then a non decimal number. I will make the default number of cycles like 6 or something so that fractions are not
needed.

When you "look" at an enemy you should also be able to see how many cycles it takes them to perform actions like walking
and attacking and carrying out the special attacks that they are likely to carry out.

Since you are in a mecha, there is a lot of equipment that you can change, but all of it will take a reasonable amount
of time to do so, so it is not something you could do in the middle of a battle.

### Attacks
I would like it if many of the more powerful weapons and attacks can not be "aimed" in the conventional way that ranged
weapons are aimed in roguelikes. Instead, it should be more like a game of chess where you must position yourself and
your enemies so that the attack will hit them. For example there may be an attack that fires a lazer in the four
cardinal directions at once, or maybe you can only fire a given weapon in a single cardinal direction.

This will m

### Levelling
Since you are in a mech it does not make much sense for you to level up IMO. However, a roguelike without levelling
would be quite gay, so I must figure out a way to make you level up.

### Improvisation


## Artistic Style
Stylistically the game should be minimalistic in such a way that it leads the player to not view the game as what they
are seeing, but that what they are seeing is just a "diagram" which allows their imagination to understand what is
happening. Putting in good atmospheric text things and stuff are good, and so is adding some cool music, but overall it
should be aiming to do things in such a way that it provides food for the player's imagination rather than conflicting
with it.

IMO this is one of the main reasons that text based roguelikes are generally the best kind, though I am ok with using
text like symbols since it is basically the same thing.

Also, there will be a built in text font, but if users want to provide their own they will also be able to do that.
